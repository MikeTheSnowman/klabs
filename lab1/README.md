# Lab 1: YAML Tutorial
---
## Lab Objective
The purpose of this lab is to provide you with some exercises to help reinforce your knowledge of YAML. Having this foundation will make your work with Kubernetes significantly easier because much of your work will involve working with configuration data in YAML format. 

But it's not just reading & writing YAML that's important. You will need to be able to read through the Kubernetes API reference documentation so that you know what what resources are available for you to modify, and then, most importantly, translate that information into YAML for your desired configuration.

## Learning outcomes:
For this lab, your goals are the following:
  - Become familiar with YAML terminology
  - Become familiar with some of the basic features & capabilities of YAML
  - Understand the high level structure of a YAML document
  - Understand what data types and data structures are available
  - Be able to read/write some basic YAML
