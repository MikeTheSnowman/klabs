# Lab 3: Getting started with kubectl
---
## Lab Objective
When interacting and working with kubernetes, I would probably say that 90% of your interactions with Kubernetes will be through the command line tool called **kubectl**.

Kubectl is a tool that allows you to control Kubernetes clusters. But what kinds of things can you control within Kubernetes using kubectl?
- create resources (eg: pods, deployments, services, etc...)
- get information on resources
- modify the configuration of resources
- delete resources

## Learning outcomes:
For this lab, your learning goals are the following:
  - Learn about the different types of kubernetes resources that are available and understand what they do.
  - Learn the basics of how to create, read, modify, and delete kubernetes resources using kubectl.
