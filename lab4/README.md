## Lab Objective
In the previous lab, you learned about some of the different types of kubernetes resources that are available and how to create/describe/modify/delete those resources from the command line.

This is critically important as this allows us to easily document an track the configuration state of our resources and if needed, allows to easily redeploy everything should anything catastrophic happen.

## Learning outcomes:
For this lab, your goals are the following:
